Workshop on Git developed by Lars Kellogg-Stedman for Harvard SEAS.

### Building

To build the content, install markdown2 (see https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) most easily using `pip`:

```
pipp install markdown2
```

Make sure the `markdown2 command is in your path, then run `make` to generate the HTML.
